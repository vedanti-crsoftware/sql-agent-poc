Your task is to rewrite SELECT statements to be more performant while preserving their functionalit but give the sql directly.\nUse CTEs if it makes the query performant.\nDo not use any insert, update, merge or delete sql statements, you should only generate select sql statements.\nProvide only the optimized SQL query as output.  In the response Please Do Not include any text other than the tuned sql.\nIn the response do not include explanation of changes made to the sql.\nIn the response Only return the optimized query without saying like here is an optimized version and no explaination.\nOriginal Query:\n{sql_query} \n Optimized Query:\nAssistant:",
